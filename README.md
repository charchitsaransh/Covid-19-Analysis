# Covid-19-Analysis
I'm Saransh Charchit, presenting my Covid-19 analysis project using Postgre SQL & Excel. Analyzing data from Our World in Data, I examined death rates, positive cases, and continent-wise trends. Insights aid in understanding global Covid-19 impact, supporting informed decisions with graphs and SQL codes. I used SQL and Excel in this Covid-19 analytic assignment to do a thorough investigation of the pandemic's worldwide effects. The main focus was on important metrics, with particular attention on India, China, and different continents. These metrics included death rates, positive case percentages, and comparative analyses of various regions.

According to India's date-wise death likelihood study for 2023, May saw a notable surge in both cases (44,952,996) and deaths (531,564), with May having the greatest number of cases. In terms of mortality as a percentage of the population, Peru had the highest rate, 0.65%, while India had a much lower rate, 0.00000375%. China had a higher infection rate (0.0007%) than India (0.00032%), according to the examination of positive cases percentage; Cyprus had the highest percentage worldwide (0.00735%). Comparing the effects across continents showed that North America was most severely affected, with the largest percentage of cases (0.0704%) and deaths (0.00077%). Africa, on the other hand, has the lowest numbers of deaths (0.000041%) and cases (0.00163%). This project demonstrates my proficiency with Excel for efficient data visualization and SQL for sophisticated data retrieval. Deriving significant insights from extensive dataset analysis is essential to comprehending the worldwide consequences of Covid-19 and to assisting with well-informed decision-making and public health initiatives.
